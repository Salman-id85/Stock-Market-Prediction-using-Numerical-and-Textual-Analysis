# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis
Data Science
#  Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock market performance by combining numerical analysis of historical stock prices with textual analysis of financial news headlines. The goal is to develop a hybrid predictive model that leverages both quantitative and qualitative data to forecast stock market trends and make informed investment decisions.

# Features
Numerical Analysis: Analyzing historical stock prices using statistical and machine learning techniques.
Textual Analysis: Evaluating the impact of financial news headlines on stock prices through sentiment analysis.
Hybrid Model: Integrating numerical and textual analyses to create a comprehensive predictive model.
Visualization: Presenting predictions and insights through various visualizations.
# Workflow
Data Collection

Numerical Data: Gather historical stock price data from sources such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
Textual Data: Collect financial news headlines related to the stock market from news APIs or financial news websites.
Data Preprocessing

Numerical Data: Clean and preprocess stock price data, including handling missing values and normalizing prices.
Textual Data: Clean and preprocess news headlines, including text normalization, tokenization, and removal of stop words.
# Numerical Analysis

Feature Engineering: Create features from historical stock prices, such as moving averages, volatility, and trading volume.
Model Development: Build and train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM) to predict stock prices based on numerical features.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
# Textual Analysis

Sentiment Analysis: Apply sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) to evaluate the sentiment of financial news headlines.
Feature Extraction: Create features based on sentiment scores and other textual metrics.
Integration: Incorporate textual features into the hybrid model to enhance predictions.
Hybrid Model Development

Model Integration: Combine numerical and textual features into a single predictive model using techniques such as ensemble learning or feature fusion.
Training and Tuning: Train the hybrid model and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
# Visualization

Prediction Visualization: Create charts and graphs to visualize stock price predictions and model performance.
Sentiment Trends: Visualize sentiment trends and their correlation with stock price movements.
# Insights and Recommendations

Performance Summary: Summarize the performance of the hybrid model and its effectiveness in predicting stock market trends.
Investment Insights: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the modelâ€™s predictions and analysis.
